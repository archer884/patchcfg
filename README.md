# PatchCfg

Want a little more torque for the TBM9? Here's a program for patching FS2020 aircraft cfg files so you don't have to: whenever Asobo puts out a patch, just run this again.

## Installation

Download the binary or install using the command:
```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/archer884/patchcfg --force
```

## Usage

Run with the following command:
```shell
$ patchcfg <path to packages> <path to patches.json>
```

The packages path should be the folder containing the aircraft packages you'd like to modify, e.g. `/FSPackages/Official/Steam`
